# End to End Testing/ Integration Testing
- Cypress

- technical debt: as you build a project, to get things to work 'hacks' are used leading to a messier and messier codebase

- refactoring: all functions same and unchanged, rearrange code
- without tests create a fear to make changes, as you don't know if all the functionalities will remain after the changes
- tests make refactoring easier

- there will be a cypress folder after installation to project folder
## Issue
- depends on implementation details

##
- good to test complicated edge cases with complicated flows
