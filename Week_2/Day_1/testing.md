# Testing

npm = node package manager
dependencies can get out of hand in tracking when package managers didn't exist

`npm install -g npm@latest` - gets the lastest version of npm

`.gitignore` - not have some files in git goes here

one file/folder

tests should be contained because the order they are run is independent of the order written. this means the variables made to calculate the 
expected and actual outputs are contained in each test 

Good for documentation in test code
Gain confidence in code - know that it work as it should
Red - break test, Green - fix it,  Refactor - rework structure
