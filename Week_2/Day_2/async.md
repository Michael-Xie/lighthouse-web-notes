# Async Control Flow

Operations don't happen in sequence as is written in code

Asynchronous programming is when a unit of work is run separately from the main thread of the program and notifies the program of its completion.

Tasks that can be run independently, can be run in conjunction and report when done, while the main task proceeds. This reduces idling as the main waits
for the subtask to complete.

Input/Output operations are known to be time consuming (read/write disk and network)

Application Programming Interface - syntax you use to interact with someone else's code.
