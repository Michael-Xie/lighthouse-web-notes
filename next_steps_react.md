# Next Steps

## React Hooks

- `useContext` allows states to be available to all components as long they are asked for
- `useCallback` and `useMemo` for increased performance
- `useRef`

## React router
- a hack to the front-end routing; has **no** relation to back-end routing

## React UI components

- materialsUI
