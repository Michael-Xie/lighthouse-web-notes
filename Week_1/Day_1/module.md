# Module

We learned that in Node,

modules are its way of organizing code into individual files
every js file in node is implicitly a module
we can console.log(module) and see its details
module.exports tells node what to export from a file
it defaults to {}
we can use require with relative paths (like ./myModule)
it doesn't need the .js extension, as that is implied
