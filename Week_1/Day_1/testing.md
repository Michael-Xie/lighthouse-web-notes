# Testing

## [The Happy Path](https://effectivecio.com/2009/11/02/the-happy-path/)
The happy path is the path through a system where everything works, the data is correct, the system stays up, and the users are well-behaved.  We tend to test the happy path first because we understand how the system should function and want to ensure that the basic features should work.

 20% of your time on the happy path; 80% of your time off of it.
