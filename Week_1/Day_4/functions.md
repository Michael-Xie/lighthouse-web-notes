VSCODE and some helpful extensions

var is function scoped
let and const are block scoped

when objects are assigned to `const`, it's only the reference and the content can be changed
however if you want to assign to something else, then error occurs

array destructuring:
`[item, item...] = array`

can skip element with `, ,`
