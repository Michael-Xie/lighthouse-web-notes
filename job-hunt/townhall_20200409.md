## Job Seeker - What we should be doing
- don't slow down on coding
- don't slow down on applying

1. Find another job seeker and work on a project
	- build a skill set
	- show improvement
	- working remotely
	- hop on video for 30 on what's going on per day
		- learn to lean each other
		- let CS know your partner
2. Reach out to a developer who worked remotely
3. Reach out to 3 to 4 alumni (and mentor) on LinkedIn and places that are interested to work at
	- ask their experience with remote work and extend network
	- developer vouching for you is big
	- set up conversations

- freelance jobs
- keep **coding**
	- smaller projects/tutorials should help with bigger projects
	- get github up-to-date

- reach out to CS
- on coverletter can explain the similarity of diff lang and frame to show you can learn quickly
- build your own 6 week curriculum and deadlines
- for interviews on hold, ask to see performance on it and see what can be improved in 4-6mo to be inline
- go for ones to say 1-3 years

- treat like it is like a job
	- meeting
	- schedule
	- once a week meeting with mentor or alumni
	- control what you can do, so it doesn't feel like it spiralling out of control
	- contribute to company's open source code
