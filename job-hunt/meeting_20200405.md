# Meeting with CS - 2020.05.05

## Questions
1. Do we qualify for the internship opportunities?
	- ones that I have looked at (ie. Amazon) requires that you are still in school and around 60% complete

## Notes
- whether coverletter should say that you should say that you just graduated from bootcamp
	- ok for up to 2 years of experience and show eagerness to learn
	- look at their tech stacks and duties and see if you can highlight your skills/experience

- time distrib
	- job search
	- project
	- learn new skills
