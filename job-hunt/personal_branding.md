# Personal Branding (June 2, 2020)
- Why?
	- there are tones of dev out there and there is **only** you
	- good news: you *already* have a brand - **understand** and **communicate** it

## The triangle
- Know Yourself
	- Interests + Skills (before, during and after bootcamp) + Values 
	- Think what you want to get in one year and align above to get the ball rolling
	- Values is something you think about and not necessarily communicated to employer (like want high income)
	- Value + Interest = Passion (Employer wants to know)
	- Interest + Skill = Aptitude
	- Value + Skill = Experience
	- Passion + Aptitude + Experience = Brand
	
	- Know your story 
		- you may not think it is interesting, **but it is**
		- where di your career begin?
		- how did you decide to transition into a career in web development

- Know Your Audience (Industry)
	- who + what + where
	- who: type of industry, size, goals, leadership, team, culture
	- what: values, skills, product/service

- Create and manage your brand
	- google (name and location) name and results
	- google images and results
	
	- I need a personal brand -> What are employers looking to see? What Do I have to offer? -> Make connections between the industry and what you have to offer (exp, apt, passion etc) -> Present your brand
	- personal presentation
	- social media
	- activity in brand
	- community involvement (hackathons, open-source contribution)
	- build relationships
- Communicate your brand confidently
	- X "I am an aspiring developer looking to gain experience"
	- Yes: YOu are a developer, YOu have unqiue
		- I am a Developer with a background in X. Passionate about Y and X.
