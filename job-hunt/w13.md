# Week 13

## Interview with BrokerBay

### Questions that need work

- What is the difference between `let` and `var`? What is hoisting?
    - `var` is globally scoped (outside function) or function/locally scoped
    - `var` can be redeclared and updated
    - `var` is initialized with undefined when hoisted
    - `let` and `const` are block scoped, which is a chunk of code bounded by {}
    - `let` can be updated but not re-declared
    - `let` and `const` are not initialized when hoisted, giving a Reference Error
    - `const` cannot be updated or redeclared
    - hoisting is JS mechanism that moves variables and functions to the top of their scope before code execution
    ```
    console.log (greeter);
    var greeter = "say hello"
    ```
    gets interpreted to:
    ```
    var greeter;
    console.log(greeter); //greeter is undefined
    greeter = "say hello"
    ```

- Describe what `app.use ... request, response, next` do

- What is a difference between get and post request in the http portion?
- Describe the equivalence of `useState` hook in class components life cycle?
- What causes a render to happen?
    - load component
    - (need checking) when a state changes
    - (need checking) when the parent of the child changes, the child will re-render
- What is the difference between `()=>{}` and `function() {}`?

### Things to know

- for deep copy, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(<code>))` wouldn't work for functions inside
    - all the types will also be strings
- `{...obj, newObj}` is only a shallow copy for the first level of object
