# MVC


Model    	=> DB => ActiveRecord
View		=> ERB Templates (like EJS in JS)
Controller	=> Project Manager - deals with user and handles request

- controller sits behind router(dispatcher)
- router decides which controller to handle request


Design or Architectural Pattern


## ERB
- if not render something at the end, ruby will imply rendering to be same as the def name

- instance variable is automatically available for rendering
- layout can be made outside of template
