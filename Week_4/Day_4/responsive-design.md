# Responsive Design

- px good for paddings, margins

- rem - relative to default font size 
- em

- 1 rem is about 16px, so go by rule of 8s like 16, 24, 32 etc... 
- helps with accessibility, which let the user dictate the font size and us using relative size to adjust accordingly


## flexbox
- order is also the order the accessibility screen reader reads
- good for one dim layout - top/bottom OR left/right

## grid
- good for two dim layout - top/bottom AND left/right
- fr - fraction unit
- ex: 1fr 2fr mean first piece takes up 1/3 space and second takes up 2/3 space
