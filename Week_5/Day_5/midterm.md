# Midterm

## db tables visualized
MAC - postico
Ubuntu - pgadmin

smart to do and pick - api learning
schoodle - front end design, build from scratch
card game - hard at start, but fun - socket.io

## Data
- new gold
- how to get your data?
- from people? from api like google maps api?
- can the data be correlated to something else?
- how can you pivot that data to add value?

## Features vs Benefits
Universal Values
- Looks good, feels good, Save time, Save money

## User Stories
- 'As a ___ I want to ____ because _______'

## User Scenarios
- 

- write 7 to 9 stories
- pick 3 or 4 stories as core app (Minimal Viable Product)

- if not going to demo, don't build
	- faq/about
	- signup pages
	- <controversy> login pages </controversy>

## Tech choices

- http://localhost:3000
- heroku

- package
	- num downloads
	- recency of update

## Routes
- RESTful conventions
- table are nouns, routes are verbs

- LastPass - app that generates and keeps password

## Wireframe

## Storyboarding

## Design
- dribbble, foliofocus, and smashing
- wix template and search for 'research'
- inspect element

- coolors.co

## Git
- branches
- do **not** code on master

## Scaffolding
- one person sets up with group around
- have all resources working before others clone

## Dividing tasks

- do something you are not as good at, the better person can support
- many ways
	- test before pushing to master
## Scrum
- 10 min 
	- what did today
	- what will do

- Code Review

- Trello board to keep track of tasks and progresses
- or github pages
	- projects tab
	- automated kanban
- icebox = stretch work
- todo, icebox, in progress, review, done
- make issues using user stories and drag to to-do
- can add assignee

## Work flow
git checkout -b <branch name>
ie. 1-feature-add-cover-blue
git branch (can see that you are at your feature branch)
git add
git commit -m<msg>
git push origin <branch name>

compare and pull request on github
- shows what'sb  added and removed
- title
- description:
	<text>
	Resolve: #<feature>
can then be reviewed, where comments can be left by teammates, card can be dragged to review

git checkout master
git checkout -b <some other branch>
<same stuff to push branch to github>

git checkout master
git pull origin master --gets the merged update

<go to branch>
git merge master --try to merge master changes to your branch and see conflicts

**don't do a pull request unless the feature is fully functional**

### vscode
- shows branch code and master code that had diff seperated by <<<<<<<<<<<< branch and <<<<< head
- remove unneed coded and save
### gitkraken to help resolve git conflicts
- shows two screen with diff
- check lines you want and will show on third screen with selected

##
LHL Node skeleton
public/styles -- **do not** write styles here
styles -- scss is here and write your css here

public/styles gets ignored

if database gets changed, get teammembers to recreate db and seeds

### look carefully at these
server.js line 36, 37
split the routes up

- gitcommit emoji to show different issues for commits
